## Dependencies

Here's a small list of some dependencies that are **crucial** for everything to work and look nice & smooth:

- [bsp-layout](https://github.com/phenax/bsp-layout)
- [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
- [pacman-contrib](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/pacman/pacman-contrib)
- [powerline-fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
- [protonvpn-cli](https://github.com/ProtonVPN/linux-cli)
- [roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)


## Notes

Some helpful information regarding the dotfiles:

- for the GTK and Qt/Kvantum themes, I use [Nordic](https://github.com/EliverLara/Nordic) by [EliverLara](https://github.com/EliverLara).
- my preferred program for setting GTK themes is `lxappearance`; for Qt/Kvantum themes, `qt5ct` & `kvantum`.

Don't forget to leave a star in the repository! Be on the lookout for updates (they may contain fixes or even new stuff!)
